        <p>Jojo's an anime that consist of 8 parts, each varying on different protagonist. Each protagonist from their respective parts

        In Jojo's bizarre adventure, the power system is based upon two powers. Initially it was hamon, where the user used 
        a breathing techinque to enhance their physical strength. And now the current power is Stands, a "ghost" that a user can control
        and each can have different abilities.<br>
