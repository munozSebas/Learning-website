      <p>I recently started Dorohedoro, the story as of now, is about two worlds. The HOLE and the world where sorcerers live
      . The sorcerers test on the people who live in the HOLE. The protagonist is a half caiman and half man, who seeking who

      The mangaka of Dorohedoro is a woman, her art style and griddiness is what caught my attention. And lead me to 
      read her story in the first place.<br>

        <p>The main character of the story Caiman, is resistent to magic, which makes him harder to defeat. And as a 
        Caiman, he is able to regenerate his body parts as well. His favorite food is Gyozas. </p>
