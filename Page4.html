      With an amazing group of side characters such as Inosuke and the Hashiras, Demon slayer to this day was the anime that slowly brought me
      back into anime and reading manga. It always keeps me on the edge of my seat.<br>

    <font face = "Century Gothic" color = "ForestGreen" size ="4" >

      <p>After reading the mangas my favorite character of the series is Obanai Iguro, his sword, style, and everything about him
      is what makes him my favorite character.</p>
