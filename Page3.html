    <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "HotPink" size = "4">

      One Piece and its greatness<br>

    </font>

    <font face = "Arial" color = "DarkKhaki" size = "3">

      <p>The highest selling manga of all time, One Piece exceeded my expectations, a simple story about a young pirate Monkey D Luffy
      striving to become the Pirate King and to find the one piece.</p>

    </font> 

    <font face = "Impact" color = "plum" size = "5" >

      Although the mangas has over 100 volumes and the still running anime has over 1000 episodes, many have are up to date to it. Myself included the idea of One Piece being pirates 
      and going on constant advetures is what always keeps it fresh.<br>

    </font>

    <font face = "Lucida Console" color = "OrangeRed" size ="1" >

      <p>With the constant adventures, we are introduced to amazing side characted. My favorite at the moment being Sanji. And the people I look forward to seeing is DonFlamingo and 
      Law.</p>
